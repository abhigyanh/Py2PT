# Py2PT.yml — configuration template
#
# Usage:
#   - Put this file in the directory where you run Py2PT (default name: Py2PT.yml), OR
#   - Point to it explicitly:
#       py2pt -c Py2PT.yml
#
# Notes:
#   - File paths below can be absolute or relative to your working directory.
#   - Units:
#       temperature: K
#       volume: Å^3  (optional; if omitted, volume is computed from the trajectory box)
#   - Valid values:
#       filter: true|false
#       filter_window: integer > 3
#       constraints: true|false
#       renormalize: false | before_f | after_f
#         (use false to disable; choose before_f/after_f to renormalize the DoS)
#       zero_correction: true|false
#

# Simulation temperature (in Kelvin)
temperature: 300.0

# Optional: the simulation volume in Å^3.
# If you leave this commented out (or set it to null), Py2PT will compute volume from the trajectory box.
# It is assumed that the simulation corresponding to the trajectory was an NVT simulation.
# volume: 123456.0

# Input files
topology: topol.tpr
trajectory: traj.trr

# Atom selection (MDAnalysis selection language is supported)
selection: all

# Parallelism (molecule-level parallel decomposition; higher nproc may speed up the analysis, but beware of memory usage)
nproc: 1

# Rotational symmetry number (e.g., 1 for most molecules; 2 for water etc)
sigma: 1

# Spectral post-processing (use Blackmann windowing before FFT, Savgol filtering after FFT)
filter: true
filter_window: 5

# Physics/model options:
# Constraint dynamics were used (SHAKE,LINCS,SETTLE etc.)
constraints: false
# Renormalize the DoS to match equipartition, so that translation and rotation DOS integrates out to (3*n_molecules)
# Options: 
# 1. false, 
# 2. before_f (before fluidicity calc)
# 3. after_f (after fluidicity calc)
renormalize: after_f
# Perform a zero-frequency correction to the total DOS by 
# shifting it vertically so that frequencies above 120ps^-1 have no residual DOS
zero_correction: false
